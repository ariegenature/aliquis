aliquis
=======

aliquis is a simple web service to manage users in an LDAP directory.

Goal is not to replace already powerful and established admin interfaces like
PHPLDAPAdmin or FusionDirectory. No aliquis simple purpose is to allow :

* an anonymous user to subscribe,

* a registered user to manage its own information,

* a registered user to recover its password.

All of this simply, with a simple, responsive, modern, and user-friendly
interface.
